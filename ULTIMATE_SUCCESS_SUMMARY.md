- 17 zones √ó 11.66‚ÇΩ = 198‚ÇΩ/day
- 3.7% of total bill!
- Often overlooked in cost analysis

### 2. Multi-Zone Architectures
- Different projects use different zones
- Dev, staging, prod zones
- Geographic zones
- Service-specific zones

### 3. Storage Accumulation
- Snapshots: 479‚ÇΩ (8.9%)
- Images: 126‚ÇΩ (2.3%)
- Registry: 76‚ÇΩ (1.4%)
- DNS: 198‚ÇΩ (3.7%)
- **Combined: 16.3% of bill!**

### 4. Managed Service Premiums
Managed services cost more than raw compute:
- PostgreSQL: +53% vs raw VM
- Kafka: +117% vs raw VM (RAM is 2x!)
- Includes backups, monitoring, HA

## üéì Key Takeaways

### 1. HAR Files Are Essential
- Provide ground truth billing data
- Reveal hidden services
- Enable accurate per-unit pricing
- Validate API discoveries

### 2. Every Service Matters
- "Minor" services can be major cost drivers
- 17 DNS zones = 198‚ÇΩ/day (3.7% of bill)
- Don't skip discovery

### 3. Service-Specific Pricing
Each managed service has unique costs:
- PostgreSQL RAM: 11.41‚ÇΩ/GB/day
- Kafka RAM: 23.33‚ÇΩ/GB/day (2x!)
- Can't assume uniform pricing

### 4. Incremental Implementation Works
- Test after each phase
- Build confidence progressively
- Catch issues early
- Adjust strategy based on findings

### 5. 99%+ Accuracy Is Achievable
- With proper API integration
- With HAR-based validation
- With comprehensive service discovery
- In reasonable timeframes (6 hours!)
