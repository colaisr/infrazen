# InfraZen Platform ‚Äì Consolidated Product Description

## 1. Vision & Positioning
- **Product:** InfraZen ‚Äì multi-cloud FinOps platform tailored to the Russian market.
- **Primary Promise:** Deliver centralized cost control, clear analytics, and actionable recommendations that reduce cloud waste by 30‚Äì70%.
- **Tagline:** "FinOps Platform" with brand message "–ú—É–ª—å—Ç–∏–æ–±–ª–∞—á–Ω—ã–π FinOps –¥–ª—è —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ä—ã–Ω–∫–∞".
- **Target Customers:** Mid-to-large enterprises spending 500k ‚ÇΩ+/month on cloud, organizations operating across 2+ cloud providers (Yandex.Cloud, VK Cloud, Selectel, Cloud.ru, etc.), MSPs, and integrators.
- **Differentiators:** Business-oriented insights (unit economics, CFO-ready reports), out-of-the-box multi-cloud integrations, auto-allocation without tags, transparent budgeting & forecasts, rapid 1-day onboarding, SaaS and on-prem deployment options.

## 2. Problem Landscape
- Enterprises struggle to control escalating cloud costs and lack a unified view across multi-cloud estates.
- Inefficient governance leads to 30‚Äì70% overspend, budget overruns, and low executive trust.
- Existing Russian-market solutions either lack multi-cloud reach, business-aligned metrics, or remain overly technical for finance stakeholders.

## 3. Solution Overview
InfraZen connects to cloud providers via API, automatically ingests billing and utilization data, applies analytics to identify "silent" spend, and offers guided optimizations delivered through a unified web experience and optional Telegram bot notifications. Implementation is manual or semi-automated, enabling quick ROI without heavy integration projects.

## 4. Core Principles & Stakeholders
- **FinOps Foundation Alignment:** Collaboration, Visibility, Optimization, Financial Accountability, Iterative Improvement.
- **Stakeholders Served:** Executives, Finance & Procurement, FinOps practitioners, Operations, Engineering teams.
- **Maturity Approach:** Crawl/Walk/Run adoption roadmap that scales capabilities with business value.

- **Typography:** System modern sans-serif family with clear hierarchy, high-contrast text for readability across roles.

## 6. Platform Architecture & Structure
- **Prototype Stack:** Flask SSR application rendering Jinja2 templates; Flask serves static assets (CSS/JS/images) alongside HTML.
- **Application Layout:** Left sidebar navigation, header with module context/actions, dynamic main content area, user profile section anchored to sidebar footer.
- **Key Directories (prototype):**
  - `src/main.py` (Flask app & routing)
  - `src/templates/` (`base.html`, `dashboard.html`, `connections.html`, `resources.html`, `page.html`, `index.html`)
  - `src/static/` (`css/style.css`, favicon, imagery)
  - `src/data/mock_data.py` (comprehensive demo data for Yandex Cloud & Selectel)
  - `src/routes/` (main.py, auth.py, user.py - modular routing)
  - `src/models/` (user.py - database models)
- **Data Flow:** Request ‚Üí Flask route ‚Üí data retrieval (DB/mocks) ‚Üí template render with injected metrics ‚Üí HTML response ‚Üí optional JS-driven interactivity (charts, forms).
- **Current Implementation Status:** Demo-ready prototype with working dashboard, connections, and resources pages. Google OAuth authentication fully implemented with profile integration. Clean separation between demo users (mock data) and real users (database data). Demo user session automatically enabled with realistic Yandex Cloud and Selectel infrastructure data (8 resources, 2 providers, cost analytics, recommendations). Real users see empty state until they add actual cloud connections. Full CRUD operations implemented for cloud provider connections with comprehensive edit functionality, provider pre-selection, and secure credential management.
