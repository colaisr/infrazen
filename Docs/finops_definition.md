# What is FinOps?

FinOps is an operational framework and cultural practice which maximizes the business value of cloud and technology, enables timely data-driven decision making, and creates financial accountability through collaboration between engineering, finance, and business teams.

## FinOps Principles

There are 6 FinOps Principles that guide the activities of a FinOps practice.

## Core Stakeholders

FinOps involves collaboration between engineering, finance, and business teams. Individuals at every level and in every area of an organization can have a different role to play in the FinOps practice: Executives, Engineers, FinOps Practitioners, Operations, Finance and Procurement.

## Maturity Model

The practice of FinOps is inherently iterative and maturity of any given process, functional activity, Capability or Domain will improve with repetition. A “Crawl, Walk, Run” maturity approach enables organizations to start small, and grow in scale, scope and complexity as business value warrants maturing a functional activity.

## FOCUS: The unified format for cloud billing data

The FinOps Foundation supports the development of an open-source technical specification for cloud cost and usage billing data, called the FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification (FOCUS™).
