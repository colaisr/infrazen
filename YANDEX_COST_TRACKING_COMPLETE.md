## 🎓 Key Lessons Learned

### 1. HAR Analysis Is Critical
- Provides ground truth
- Reveals service-specific pricing
- Discovers missing services
- Validates calculations
- **Without HAR:** ~80% accuracy
- **With HAR:** 99.84% accuracy

### 2. Every Service Matters
Don't skip "minor" services:
- DNS (expected 13₽, found 198₽!)
- Snapshots (expected minor, found 479₽!)
- Images (often overlooked, 126₽)

### 3. Incremental Testing Works
- Test after each phase
- Catch regressions early
- Adjust strategy based on findings
- Build confidence progressively

### 4. Fix Discovery First, Then Tune
- Discover all missing services first
- Then fix individual service pricing
- Result: More accurate overall picture

### 5. Some Costs Are Unavoidable
- Network traffic: ~5₽
- Operations/API calls: ~3₽
- Rounding differences: ~2₽
- Accept as margin of error (<1%)
