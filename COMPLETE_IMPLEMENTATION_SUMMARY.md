## üî¨ Technical Discoveries

### 1. Service-Specific Pricing Models

Each managed service has unique per-unit costs:

| Service | CPU/day | RAM/GB/day | Storage/GB/day |
|---------|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Compute VM** | 27‚ÇΩ | 7.20‚ÇΩ | 0.0031‚ÇΩ (HDD) |
| **PostgreSQL** | 42.25‚ÇΩ | 11.41‚ÇΩ | 0.1152‚ÇΩ (HDD) |
| **Kafka** | 43.55‚ÇΩ | **23.33‚ÇΩ** | 0.1152‚ÇΩ (HDD) |

**Key Insight:** Kafka RAM is 2x PostgreSQL RAM!

### 2. Storage Cost Drivers

Snapshots and images are major hidden costs:
- **Snapshots:** 479‚ÇΩ/day (11% of Compute Cloud!)
- **Images:** 126‚ÇΩ/day (3% of Compute Cloud)
- **Combined:** 605‚ÇΩ/day (11.7% of total bill)

### 3. Kubernetes Billing Split

Yandex bills K8s across multiple services:
- **Master:** "Managed Kubernetes" (228‚ÇΩ)
- **Workers:** "Compute Cloud" (VMs)
- **Load Balancers:** "Load Balancer" service (81‚ÇΩ for 2 LBs)

### 4. Public IP Costs

Not free, even when active:
- **Active VM IPs:** 6.22‚ÇΩ/day each
- **Reserved IPs:** 4.61‚ÇΩ/day each
- **Kafka IP:** 6.22‚ÇΩ/day
- **LB IPs:** Included in LB cost (40.44‚ÇΩ/day per LB)

### 5. HAR Analysis > Documentation

HAR files provided:
- Exact per-unit pricing
- Service-specific rates
- Missing service discovery
- Validation of calculations

Without HAR: ~80% accuracy  
With HAR: **96.49% accuracy**

## üéì Lessons Learned

### 1. Fix Discovery Before Tuning
- Discovered all missing services first (Phase 1, 3, 4)
- Then fixed individual service pricing (Phase 2)
- Result: More accurate overall picture

### 2. Overestimates Can Mask Gaps
- PostgreSQL overestimate (+95‚ÇΩ) hid Kafka gap (-198‚ÇΩ)
- Fixing PG revealed the true missing services
- Overall accuracy dropped temporarily but became more truthful

### 3. Incremental Testing Works
- Test after each phase
- Catch issues immediately
- Build confidence progressively

### 4. HAR Files Are Gold
- Provide ground truth
- Reveal actual billing behavior
- Enable precise per-unit pricing

### 5. Some Costs Are Unavoidable
- Compute misc (traffic, operations): ~163‚ÇΩ
- This represents ~3% of bill
- Difficult to attribute to specific resources
- Accept as margin of error

## üìà Business Impact

### Monthly Cost Projection Accuracy:

**yc-it environment example:**

**Before Implementation:**
- Monthly estimate: ~129,000‚ÇΩ
- Real bill: ~162,000‚ÇΩ
- Error: 33,000‚ÇΩ/month (20%)
- Reliability: Low

**After Implementation:**
- Monthly estimate: ~156,000‚ÇΩ
- Real bill: ~162,000‚ÇΩ
- Error: 6,000‚ÇΩ/month (3.5%)
- Reliability: High

**Improvement:**
- Error reduced by **82%**
- From "rough guess" to "reliable forecast"
- Can confidently budget and forecast costs

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Phase 5: Polish (2-3 hours)
**Target:** 96.49% ‚Üí 98%+

Would add:
- DNS Zones (~13‚ÇΩ)
- Fix NAT Gateway (~9‚ÇΩ)
- KMS (~3‚ÇΩ)
- S3 Object Storage (~2‚ÇΩ)

**Expected Result:** ~97.5% accuracy

**Remaining Gap:** ~163‚ÇΩ (Compute misc - traffic, operations, rounding)

- All major services tracked (10 types)
- Remaining 190‚ÇΩ is mostly Compute misc (traffic, operations)
- ROI on Phase 5 is low (2-3 hours for 1% improvement)

### Option B: Complete Phase 5 (2-3 hours)
**Reasoning:**
- Reach 97.5%+ accuracy
- Add DNS, NAT, KMS, S3
- Near-complete service coverage
- Perfectionist approach

### Option C: Accept Current State
**Reasoning:**
- 96.49% is production-grade
- Cost/benefit ratio of Phase 5 is poor
- Focus on other features
