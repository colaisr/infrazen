## 🎯 Demo Boards Created

### **1. Customer Allocation** 💰 (DEFAULT BOARD)
**Business Value:** Unit economics, customer profitability, pricing validation

**Groups:**
- 📊 **Customer A (Enterprise)** - Blue - Dedicated high-value infrastructure
- 📊 **Customer B (SMB)** - Green - Mid-tier customer  
- 📊 **Customer C (Trial)** - Orange - Trial customer (minimal resources)
- 🏢 **Shared Infrastructure** - Gray - Multi-tenant resources

**Resources Placed:** 9 resources
- Customer A: `api-backend-prod-01`, `db-postgres-prod-01`, `s3-cdn-static`
- Customer B: `web-frontend-01`, `db-mysql-staging`
- Customer C: `dev-vps-01`
- Shared: `lb-prod-01`, `k8s-worker-01`, `k8s-worker-02`

**Key Insights Demonstrated:**
```
• Customer A: High margin (41%) - dedicated infrastructure justified
• Customer B: Medium margin - shared resources reduce costs
• Customer C: UNPROFITABLE (Trial) - needs conversion or shutdown
• Shared Infrastructure: Distributed across customers

BUSINESS DECISIONS:
→ Revisit pricing for Customer C or move to shared
→ Customer A shows efficiency of dedicated model
→ Visible cost per customer for decision making
```

**System Notes Added:**
- `api-backend-prod-01`: "Dedicated API backend for Customer A. 99.9% SLA. Critical for enterprise contract."
- `db-postgres-prod-01`: "Customer A dedicated database. Contains sensitive enterprise data."
- `s3-cdn-static`: "Customer A static assets and CDN distribution."
- `lb-prod-01`: "Shared load balancer serving all customers. Multi-tenant architecture."

• Mobile API: 18K₽/month, core feature, 80% users - optimize carefully
• Chat & Messaging: 16K₽/month - engagement feature
• Search Engine: 36K₽/month - product advantage

PRODUCT DECISIONS:
→ Analytics: high cost justified by enterprise revenue
→ Mobile API: critical for retention, invest in performance

### **3. Environment & Teams** 🏗️
**Business Value:** Team accountability, environment cost visibility, dev/prod ratio insights

**Groups:**
- 🚀 **Production (Team: Platform)** - Red - All production resources
- 🧪 **Staging (Team: QA)** - Orange - Staging/test resources  
- 💻 **Development (Team: Engineering)** - Green - Dev environments
- 🤖 **CI/CD (Team: DevOps)** - Purple - Build runners and test infrastructure

**Resources Placed:** 13 resources
- Production: `api-backend-prod-01`, `db-postgres-prod-01`, `lb-prod-01`, `vps-app-01`, `vps-db-01`

- CI/CD: `ci-runner-spot`, `test-runner-01`, `ci-dev-runner`

**Key Insights Demonstrated:**
```
• Production (60%): 180K₽/month - healthy ratio ✅
• Staging (12%): 38K₽/month - optimal level ✅
• Development (32%): 95K₽/month - TOO HIGH ⚠️ (should be <20%)
• CI/CD (8%): 25K₽/month - can optimize with spot instances

OPERATIONAL DECISIONS:
→ Dev environment excessive - consider shared dev infrastructure
→ CI/CD: idle 75% of time - auto-shutdown saves 60%
→ Healthy ratios: Prod 60-70%, Staging 15-20%, Dev 10-15%
```

**System Notes Added:**
- `ci-runner-spot`: "Idle 75% of time. Consider auto-shutdown schedule for cost savings."

• ⚠️ Medium Priority: 12K₽/month potential savings
• ✅ Optimized: Right-sized resources (best practices applied)

WORKFLOW:
1. New recommendations → High Priority
2. Under analysis → Medium Priority
3. Optimized → Optimized

INSIGHTS:
→ Visual pipeline for tracking optimization progress
→ Group resources by savings priority
→ Drag & drop between groups as actions complete
```

**System Notes Added:**
- `vps-app-01`: "Right-sized. Monitoring shows optimal CPU/RAM usage."
- `vps-cache-01`: "Perfectly sized Redis cache. No optimization needed."
