  - `src/main.py` (Flask app & routing)
  - `src/templates/` (`base.html`, `dashboard.html`, `connections.html`, `resources.html`, `page.html`, `index.html`)
  - `src/static/` (`css/style.css`, favicon, imagery)
  - `src/data/mock_data.py` (comprehensive demo data for Yandex Cloud & Selectel)
  - `src/routes/` (main.py, auth.py, user.py - modular routing)
  - `src/models/` (user.py - database models)
- **Data Flow:** Request → Flask route → data retrieval (DB/mocks) → template render with injected metrics → HTML response → optional JS-driven interactivity (charts, forms).
- **Current Implementation Status:** Demo-ready prototype with working dashboard, connections, and resources pages. Google OAuth authentication fully implemented with profile integration. Clean separation between demo users (mock data) and real users (database data). Demo user session automatically enabled with realistic Yandex Cloud and Selectel infrastructure data (8 resources, 2 providers, cost analytics, recommendations). Real users see empty state until they add actual cloud connections.

## 6.1. Multi-Cloud Sync Architecture

### 6.1.1. Sync System Overview
The InfraZen platform implements a comprehensive multi-cloud synchronization system designed to provide real-time visibility into cloud resources, costs, and utilization across all connected providers. The sync architecture is built on a snapshot-based approach that enables historical analysis, trend tracking, and AI-powered optimization recommendations.

### 6.1.2. Core Sync Components

#### **Sync Models & Database Schema**
- **`SyncSnapshot`**: Tracks metadata for each sync operation including timing, status, resource counts, and cost totals
- **`ResourceState`**: Records the state of individual resources during each sync, enabling change detection and historical tracking
- **`Resource`**: Universal resource registry storing normalized data from all cloud providers
- **`CloudProvider`**: Provider connection management with credential storage and sync status tracking

#### **Sync Service Architecture**
- **`SyncService`**: Core orchestration service that manages the entire sync process
- **Provider Clients**: Specialized API clients for each cloud provider (Beget, Yandex.Cloud, Selectel, AWS, Azure, GCP)
- **Change Detection**: Automated comparison between current and previous resource states
- **State Management**: Tracks resource lifecycle (created, updated, deleted, unchanged)

### 6.1.3. Sync Process Flow

#### **Manual Sync Trigger**
1. User clicks "Синхронизировать" button on connection card
2. `SyncService` creates new `SyncSnapshot` with "running" status
3. Provider-specific client authenticates and fetches all resources
4. Service compares current resources with existing database records
5. Creates/updates/deletes `Resource` entries as needed
6. Records `ResourceState` entries for change tracking
7. Updates `SyncSnapshot` with completion status and statistics
8. Updates provider's `last_sync` timestamp

#### **Resource Processing Logic**
- **New Resources**: Create `Resource` entry with provider-specific configuration stored as JSON
- **Existing Resources**: Compare fields and update if changes detected
- **Deleted Resources**: Mark as inactive with "deleted" status
- **Change Detection**: Track cost changes, status changes, and configuration changes

### 6.1.4. Data Normalization & Storage

## 6.2. Daily Cost Baseline Implementation

### 6.2.1. FinOps Strategy Overview
The InfraZen platform implements a **daily cost baseline strategy** for unified cost analysis across all cloud providers. This approach provides FinOps teams with consistent daily metrics for cost optimization, resource right-sizing, and budget forecasting.

### 6.2.2. Database Schema Enhancement
**New Resource Fields:**
- `daily_cost`: Normalized daily cost for FinOps analysis
- `original_cost`: Original provider cost (monthly/yearly)
- `cost_period`: Cost period (daily, monthly, yearly, hourly)
- `cost_frequency`: Cost frequency (recurring, usage-based, one-time)

**Schema Migration:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE resources ADD COLUMN daily_cost FLOAT DEFAULT 0.0;
ALTER TABLE resources ADD COLUMN original_cost FLOAT DEFAULT 0.0;
ALTER TABLE resources ADD COLUMN cost_period VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE resources ADD COLUMN cost_frequency VARCHAR(20);
```

### 6.2.3. Cost Normalization Logic
**Automatic Conversion Rules:**
- **Daily**: Use as-is (22 RUB/day)
- **Monthly**: Convert to daily (660 RUB ÷ 30 = 22 RUB/day)
- **Yearly**: Convert to daily (÷ 365)
- **Hourly**: Convert to daily (× 24)

**Implementation:**
```python
@staticmethod
def normalize_to_daily_cost(original_cost, period, frequency='recurring'):
    if period == 'daily': return original_cost
    elif period == 'monthly': return original_cost / 30
    elif period == 'yearly': return original_cost / 365
    elif period == 'hourly': return original_cost * 24
    else: return original_cost / 30  # default to monthly
```

### 6.2.4. Provider Integration
**Beget API Enhancement:**
- Extract `price_day` when available from Beget API
- Fallback to `price_month ÷ 30` for daily baseline
- Store both original and normalized costs

**Sync Service Integration:**
- `_create_new_resource()` uses daily cost baseline
- `_update_existing_resource()` updates daily costs
- Automatic cost normalization during sync

### 6.2.5. UI Enhancement
**Resource Cards Display:**
- **Primary**: Daily cost (22.00 RUB/day) - Prominent display
- **Secondary**: Monthly cost (660.00 RUB/month) - Reference information
- Professional FinOps cost presentation

**CSS Implementation:**
```css
.cost-primary {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
}
.cost-amount {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    font-weight: 700;
    color: var(--primary-blue);
}
.cost-secondary {
    padding-top: 0.5rem;
    border-top: 1px solid var(--border-light);
}
```
