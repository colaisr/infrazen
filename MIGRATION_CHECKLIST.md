- [ ] Set appropriate LOG_LEVEL

### Phase 4: Database Initialization
- [ ] Run `python init_database.py` on VPS
- [ ] Production schema created
- [ ] Super admin created
- [ ] Demo user seeded
- [ ] Validation script passed

### Phase 5: Application Deployment
- [ ] Configure Gunicorn
- [ ] Test application start
- [ ] Configure systemd service
- [ ] Enable service auto-start
- [ ] Configure Nginx reverse proxy (optional)
